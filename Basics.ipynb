    "Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator [Y Combinator]('https://www.ycombinator.com/'), where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the data set [here]('https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts'), but note that we have reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that didn't receive any comments and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions. Below are descriptions of the columns:\n",
    "* `id`: the unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "* `title`: the title of the post\n",
    "* `url`: the URL that the posts links to, if the post has a URL\n",
    "* `num_points`: the number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "* `num_comments`: the number of comments on the post\n",
    "* `author`: the username of the person who submitted the post\n",
    "* `created_at`: the date and time of the post's submission\n",
    "We're mostly interested in the posts that have titles which comprise `Ask HN` OR `Show HN`. Normally, Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.\n",
    "same to `Show HN` where users submit `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something interesting.\n",
    "we will compare these posts according to the two properties to determine:\n",
    "* Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more comments on average?\n",
    "* Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?"

    "In the entire project, we analyzed ask posts and show posts to determine which type of post and time receives the most comments on average. Based on our analysis, to maximize the amount of comments a post receives, we'd recommend the post be categorized as ask post and created between `15:00/22:00` and `16:00/23:00` ___(3:00 pm est/10:00 pm utc+3 - 4:00 pm est/11:00 pm utc+3)___.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it should be noted that the data set we analyzed excluded posts without any comments. Given that, it's more accurate to say that of the posts that received comments, ask posts received more comments on average and ask posts created between 15:00 and 16:00 (3:00 pm est - 4:00 pm est) received the most comments on average."
