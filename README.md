# Hacker News Project
In the entire project, we analyzed ask posts and show posts to determine which type of post and time receives the most comments on average. Based on our analysis, to maximize the amount of comments a post receives, we'd recommend the post be categorized as ask post and created between 15:00/22:00 and 16:00/23:00 (3:00 pm est/10:00 pm utc+3 - 4:00 pm est/11:00 pm utc+3).
